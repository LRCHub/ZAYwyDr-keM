Good evening!

When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

She comes and goes, and comes and goes
Like no one can, yeah

Tonight, she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats, it's always
Heavy into everything

She comes and goes, she comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes, and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon, yeah
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away, yeah

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her any way I can

She comes and she goes
Like no one can, like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon, yeah
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
She burns away
Oh, she burns...

Oh, she comes and she goes
Like no one can, yeah, like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping, oh, through my hands

Oh, she's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Thank you, and good evening!
