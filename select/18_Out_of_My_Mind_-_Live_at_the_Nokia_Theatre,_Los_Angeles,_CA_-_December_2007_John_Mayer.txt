I'm putting you
I'm putting you out of my mind
I'm putting you
I'm putting you right out of my mind
I'm so tired of running after you
One-and-one-half steps behind
Go tell your friends
Go tell your friends what Johnny did
Yeah, go tell your friends
Go tell your friends what Johnny did
If they don't laugh right at you
They just as fucked up as you is
If I don't see you tomorrow
See you another day, I'm sure
If I don't see you tomorrow
See you another day, I'm sure
I'll run into you at your job
You be waiting for me outside the stage door
I'm putting you
I'm putting you right out of my mind
I'm putting you, baby
I'll put you right out of my mind
So tired of chasing after you
Being one-and-one-half steps behind
